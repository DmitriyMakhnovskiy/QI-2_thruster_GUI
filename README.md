This high voltage source, capable of delivering up to 4 kV with a power output of 10 W, was developed at the University of Plymouth, UK, as part of a DARPA-funded project (HR001118C0125) investigating quantised inertia (QI). The system was integrated with a Raspberry Pi 4B, enabling automated measurements and remote control. A Python-based graphical user interface (main.py) was developed to facilitate user-friendly operation and precise control of the system.

Quantised Inertia (QI) is a theoretical framework that proposes inertia arises from quantum interactions with the universe’s horizon, offering a new perspective on fundamental physical concepts. This project focused on supporting experimental studies of QI, with this high voltage source serving as a key tool in ensuring reliable and consistent measurements.

Developed within the University of Plymouth, this system highlights the integration of software and hardware to meet the specific demands of cutting-edge research, providing a foundation for further exploration in the field.
